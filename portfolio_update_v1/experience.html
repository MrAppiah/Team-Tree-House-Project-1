				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p>
					My story in software development started when I was unsure of what I
					wanted to do with my life. Even though I had big goals and dreams I
					didn't know what career path was right for me. Long story short; I
					spoke to a stranger outside and he told me to do some research into
					software engineering. Furthermore, I used to get recommended videos on
					youtube on how people became self-taught software
					developers/engineers.
				</p>

				<p>
					I have some experience before doing this course. I first went on
					Codecademy and used their free resources and then I purchased online
					courses on udemy. I now have 3 projects and a portfolio. Even though
					these courses have helped me, I don't think I've learnt a lot because
					the structure of the courses isn't as good as treehouse. Instead of
					being tested and challenged you just code alone and watch videos at
					the same time, it's not engaging and it doesn't suit my learning
					style. My plan is o learn all of the foundations again and improve my
					js skills, then learn a framework.
